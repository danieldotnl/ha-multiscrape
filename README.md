## Important note: troubleshooting

If you don't manage to scrape the value you are looking for, please [enable debug logging](#debug-logging) and `log_response`. This will provide you with a lot of information for continued investigation. `log_response` will write all responses to files. If the value you want to scrape is not in the files with the output from BeautifulSoup (\*-soup.txt), Multiscrape will not be able to scrape it. Most likely it is retrieved in the background by javascript. Your best chance in this case, is to investigate the network traffic in de developer tools of your browser, and try to find a json response containing the value you are looking for.

If all of this doesn't help, use the home assistant forum. I cannot give everyone personal assistance and please don't create github issues unless you are sure there is a bug.
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape/wiki) for a scraping guide and other details on the functionality of this component.

## Important note: be a good citizen and be aware of your responsibility

You and you alone, are accountable for your scraping activities. Be a good (web) citizen. Set reasonable `scan_interval` timings, seek explicit permission before scraping, and adhere to local and international laws. Respect website policies, handle data ethically, mind resource usage, and regularly monitor your actions. Uphold these principles to ensure ethical and sustainable scraping practices.

# HA MultiScrape custom component

This Home Assistant custom component can scrape multiple fields (using CSS selectors) from a single HTTP request (the existing scrape sensor can scrape a single field only). The scraped data becomes available in separate sensors.

It is based on both the existing [Rest sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest/) and the [Scrape sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape). Most properties of the Rest and Scrape sensor apply.

|      | See [Selector](#Selector) fields          | True     |         |        |

### Form-submit

Configure the form-submit functionality which enables you to submit a (login) form before scraping a site. More details on how this works [can be found on the wiki](https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape/wiki/Form-submit-functionality).

| name              | description                                                                                               | required | default | type                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| resource          | The url for the site with the form                                                                        | False    |         | string              |
| select            | CSS selector used for selecting the form in the html. When omitted, the input fields are directly posted. | False    |         | string              |
| input             | A dictionary with name/values which will be merged with the input fields on the form                      | False    |         | string - dictionary |

### Form Variables

Configure the variables that will be scraped from the [`form_submit`](#form-submit) response. You will be able to use those values in the `value_template` of a header or a selector in the main configuration. A common use case is to populate the `X-Login-Token` header which is the result of the login.

| name | description                      | required | default | type   |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| name | Name of the variable             | True     |         | string |
|      | See [Selector](#Selector) fields | True     |         |        |

Example:

```yaml
multiscrape:
  - resource: "https://somesiteyouwanttoscrape.com"
    form_submit:
      submit_once: True
      resource: "https://authforsomesiteyouwanttoscrape.com"
      input:
        email: "<email>"
        password: "<password>"
      variables:
        - name: token
          value_template: "{{ ... }}"
    headers:
      X-Login-Token: "{{ token }}"
    sensor: ...
```

### Selector

| on_error       | See [On-error](#on-error)                                                                                                                             | False    |         |                 |

### On-error

Configure what should happen in case of a scraping error (the css selector does not return a value).

| name    | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | required | default | type   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| log     | Determines if and how something should be logged in case of a scraping error. Value can be either 'false', 'info', 'warning' or 'error'.                                                                                                                                | False    | error   | string |
| value   | Determines what value the sensor/attribute should get in case of a scraping error. The value can be 'last' meaning that the value does not change, 'none' which results in HA showing 'Unkown' on the sensor, or 'default' which will show the specified default value. | False    | none    | string |
| default | The default value to be used when the on-error value is set to 'default'.                                                                                                                                                                                               | False    |         | string |

## Services

For each multiscrape instance, a service will be created to trigger a scrape run through an automation. (For manual triggering, the button entity can now be configured.)
The services are named `multiscrape.trigger_{name of integration}`.

Multiscrape also offers a `get_content` and a `scrape` service. `get_content` retrieves the content of the website you want to scrape. It shows the same data for which you now need to enable `log_response` and open the page_soup.txt file.\
`scrape` does what it says. It scrapes a website and provides the sensors and attributes.

Both services accept the same configuration as what you would provide in your configuration yaml (what is described above), with a small but important caveat: if the service input contains templates, those are automatically parsed by home assistant when the service is being called. That is fine for templates like `resource` and `select`, but templates that need to be applied on the scraped data itself (like `value_template`), cannot be parsed when the service is called. Therefore you need to slightly alter the syntax and add a `!` in the middle. E.g. `{{` becomes `{!{` and `%}` becomes `%!}`. Multiscrape will then understand that this string needs to handled as a template after the service has been called.\
_If someone has a better solution, please let me know!_

To call one of those services, go to 'Developer tools' in Home Assistant and then to 'services'. Find the `multiscrape.get_content` or `multiscrape.scrape` services and go to yaml mode. There you enter your configuration.
Example:

```yaml
service: multiscrape.scrape
data:
  name: HA scraper
  resource: https://www.home-assistant.io
  sensor:
    - unique_id: ha_latest_version
      name: Latest version
      select: ".current-version > h1:nth-child(1)"
      value_template: '{!{ (value.split(":")[1]) }!}'
    - unique_id: ha_release_date
      name: Release date
      select: ".release-date"
```

## Debug logging

Debug logging can be enabled as follows:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.multiscrape: debug
```

Depending on your issue, also consider enabling `log_response`.
